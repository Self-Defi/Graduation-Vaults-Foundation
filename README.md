# Graduation-Vaults-Foundation  
## GV-Foundation

Institutional-grade, non-custodial governance standards for Graduation Vaults.

---

## Purpose

GV-Foundation defines the **canonical architecture, governance rules, and operational boundaries** for Graduation Vaults built using **SAFE smart accounts** and **Zodiac governance modules**.

This repository is **not** a product, protocol, or platform.

It is a **governed reference standard** used to deploy, operate, audit, and enforce student-specific donation vaults.

All documents in this repository describe **enforced behavior**, not discretionary policy.
