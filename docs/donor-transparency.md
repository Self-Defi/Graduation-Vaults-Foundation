# Donor Transparency & Expectations

**Graduation Vault Foundation — Plain-Language Guide for Donors & Sponsors**

---

## Why Graduation Vaults Exist

Graduation Vaults exist to solve a common problem in education funding:

Donors want to support students, but traditional donation systems make it difficult to verify where funds go, how they are protected, and whether they reach the intended student.

Graduation Vaults provide a **direct, transparent, and protected pathway** from donor contribution to student benefit — without relying on trust in any single institution or individual.

---

## What Happens When You Donate

When you donate to a Graduation Vault:

- Your donation goes **directly into a digital vault** created for a specific student
- The vault is secured by multiple independent signers
- No single person or organization can access the funds alone
- Funds remain locked until graduation or documented hardship

There are no pooled accounts, discretionary transfers, or hidden reallocations.

---

## What a Graduation Vault Is (and Is Not)

### A Graduation Vault IS:
- A student-specific donation vault
- Governed by parents, school representatives, staff, and an independent trustee
- Fully transparent and publicly verifiable
- Locked by default until graduation

### A Graduation Vault IS NOT:
- A bank account
- An investment or savings product
- A yield- or interest-generating account
- A discretionary scholarship fund

Your donation is **protected**, not invested.

---

## Who Can Access the Funds

Access to funds is controlled by **shared governance**, not discretion.

Each vault has four independent signers:
- Parent or Guardian (mandatory)
- School Representative
- Teacher, Counselor, or Staff Member
- Independent Trustee or Community Oversight Member

### Graduation Release
- Requires approval from **at least 3 of the 4 signers**
- Must include the Parent or Guardian
- Funds are released to a **Student + Parent joint SAFE**

### Emergency / Hardship Release
- Requires approval from **all 4 signers**
- Requires documented hardship
- Limited to the minimum necessary amount

No donor, operator, or advisor can override these rules.

---

## Transparency & Verification

Graduation Vaults are built on public, auditable infrastructure.

This means:
- Every donation is recorded on a public ledger
- Vault balances are visible in real time
- Withdrawals are permanently traceable
- Anyone can independently verify activity

You do not need to request reports or trust summaries.  
**The ledger is the record.**

---

## What Operators and Advisors Cannot Do

To be explicit:
- Operators do not hold keys
- Advisors do not manage funds
- Schools do not have unilateral control
- No one can move funds on your behalf

If a transaction violates governance rules, it cannot occur.

---

## If Circumstances Change

### If a Student Leaves the Program
- The vault remains intact
- Governance rules determine next steps
- Funds are not automatically seized or reallocated

### If a Signer Changes
- Replacements follow documented procedures
- Parent/Guardian role cannot be removed

### If a School Transitions or Closes
- Vaults remain verifiable and accessible
- Student funds cannot be absorbed by the institution

---

## Graduation & Beyond

At graduation:
- Funds move to a **Student + Parent joint vault**
- The student gains hands-on experience with shared custody
- Parents may step back over time as appropriate

Your donation directly supports the student’s next chapter.

---

## What Graduation Vaults Do Not Promise

Graduation Vaults do not promise:
- Financial returns
- Interest or yield
- Market performance
- Guaranteed outcomes

They promise **transparency, protection, and accountability**.

---

## Final Assurance

As a donor:
- You contribute
- You verify
- The system enforces the rules

Graduation Vaults ensure your generosity is:
- Visible
- Purpose-bound
- Protected
- Student-centered
