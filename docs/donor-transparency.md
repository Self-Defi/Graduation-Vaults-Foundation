# Donor Transparency & Expectations

**Graduation Vault Foundation — Plain-Language Guide for Donors & Sponsors**

---

## Why Graduation Vaults Exist

Graduation Vaults exist to provide a direct, transparent, and protected pathway from donor contribution to student benefit — without relying on trust in any single institution or individual.

They replace discretionary control with cryptographically enforced governance.

---

## What Happens When You Donate

When you donate:
- Your donation goes directly into a vault created for a specific student
- No single person or organization can access the funds alone
- Funds remain locked until graduation or documented hardship
- All activity is publicly verifiable

There are no pooled accounts, discretionary transfers, or hidden reallocations.

---

## What a Graduation Vault Is (and Is Not)

A Graduation Vault is:
- A student-specific donation vault
- Governed by multiple independent signers
- Locked by default until graduation
- Transparent and auditable

A Graduation Vault is not:
- A bank account
- An investment product
- A yield-generating account
- A discretionary scholarship fund

Your donation is protected — not invested.

---

## Who Can Access the Funds

Each vault has four independent signers:
- Parent or Guardian (mandatory)
- School Representative
- Staff Member (teacher/counselor)
- Independent Trustee

Graduation Release:
- 3-of-4 approvals required
- Parent approval required
- Funds released to Student + Parent joint SAFE

Emergency / Hardship:
- 4-of-4 approvals required
- Documented hardship required
- Minimal amount only

No donor, operator, or advisor can override these rules.

---

## Transparency & Verification

Graduation Vaults are built on public infrastructure:
- Donations are recorded on a public ledger
- Balances are visible in real time
- Withdrawals are permanently traceable

The ledger is the record.

---

## What Operators and Advisors Cannot Do

- Do not hold keys
- Do not manage funds
- Do not approve transactions
- Do not execute withdrawals

If a transaction violates rules, it cannot occur.

---

## If Circumstances Change

If a student leaves:
- The vault remains intact
- Governance rules determine next steps

If a signer changes:
- Replacement follows documented procedures
- Parent role cannot be removed

If a school transitions:
- Vaults remain verifiable and cannot be absorbed by the institution

---

## Graduation & Beyond

At graduation:
- Funds move to Student + Parent joint SAFE
- The student gains shared custody experience
- Parents may step back later

Your donation supports the student’s next chapter.

---

## What Graduation Vaults Do Not Promise

They do not promise:
- Returns
- Yield
- Performance
- Outcomes

They promise transparency, protection, and accountability.

---

## Final Assurance

As a donor:
- You contribute
- You verify
- The system enforces the rules

Graduation Vaults ensure your donation remains visible, purpose-bound, and student-centered.
