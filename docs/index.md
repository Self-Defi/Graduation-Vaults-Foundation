# Graduation-Vaults-Foundation  
## GV-Foundation

**Institutional-grade, non-custodial governance standards for Graduation Vaults**

---

## Purpose

GV-Foundation defines the **canonical architecture, governance rules, and operational boundaries** for Graduation Vaults.

This repository is not a product, protocol, or platform.  
It is a **governed reference standard** used to deploy, operate, and audit student-specific donation vaults built on **SAFE smart accounts** and **Zodiac governance modules**.

All documents in this repository describe **enforced behavior**, not discretionary policy.
