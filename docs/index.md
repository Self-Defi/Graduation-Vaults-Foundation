# Graduation-Vaults-Foundation  
**GV-Foundation** — institutional-grade, non-custodial governance standards for Graduation Vaults.

## Purpose {#purpose}

GV-Foundation defines the **canonical architecture, governance rules, and enforced behaviors** for Graduation Vault systems built using SAFE smart accounts and Zodiac governance modules.

This repository is **not** a product, protocol, or platform.  
It is a **governed reference standard** used to deploy, operate, and audit Graduation Vault governance modules.

All documents in this repository describe **enforced behavior**, not discretionary guidance.
