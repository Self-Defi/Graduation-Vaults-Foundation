# Signer Onboarding & Responsibilities

**Graduation Vault Foundation — Plain-Language Guide for Signers**

---

## Why You Are a Signer

As a signer, you hold a **governance role**, not a financial or managerial role.

Graduation Vaults are designed so that no single person controls student funds. Decisions require **shared approval** to protect students, donors, and institutions.

Being a signer means:
- You help safeguard a student’s future
- You participate only at key decision points
- You act as a check against misuse or mistakes

You do not manage funds day-to-day.

## What a Graduation Vault Is (and Is Not)

### A Graduation Vault IS:
- A secure digital vault for student donations
- Locked until graduation or documented hardship
- Governed by multiple independent signers
- Fully transparent and auditable

### A Graduation Vault IS NOT:
- A bank account
- An investment product
- A trading or savings account

No interest is earned. No investments are made.

---

## Signer Roles

Each vault has four signers:

### Parent / Guardian (Mandatory)
- Must approve all withdrawals
- Represents the student’s long-term interests
- Cannot be removed or bypassed

### School Representative
- Confirms enrollment and graduation status
- Ensures institutional alignment

### Teacher / Counselor / Staff
- Brings a student-centered perspective
- Participates in graduation and hardship decisions

### Independent Trustee
- Provides neutral oversight
- Helps prevent conflicts of interest

All signers have **equal voting power**.

---

## How Decisions Are Made

### Graduation Withdrawal
- Requires **3 of 4** approvals
- Parent approval is mandatory
- Funds go to a **Student + Parent joint SAFE**

### Emergency / Hardship Withdrawal
- Requires **4 of 4** approvals
- Requires documented hardship
- Limited to the minimum necessary amount

No signer can act alone.

---

## What You Will Do

In practice, you will:
- Review proposals when notified
- Approve or reject them
- Ask questions when needed

Most signers act **once or twice over several years**.

---

## What You Are Not Responsible For

You are not responsible for:
- Investment performance
- Market conditions
- Technical infrastructure
- Donor behavior
- Daily monitoring

Your responsibility is limited to **good-faith governance decisions**.

---

## Transparency

All activity is:
- Recorded on a public ledger
- Independently verifiable
- Visible to donors and families

There are no hidden accounts.

---

## Graduation & Transition

At graduation:
- Funds move to a Student + Parent joint vault
- Students learn shared custody
- Parents may step back later

This transition is intentional and educational.

---

## Key Assurance

- No operator holds keys
- No advisor controls funds
- Rules are enforced by code

If something violates the rules, it cannot happen.
