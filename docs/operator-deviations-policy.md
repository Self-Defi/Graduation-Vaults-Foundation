# Operator Deviations & Extensions Policy

**Graduation Vault Foundation — Ecosystem Governance Standard**

---

## Purpose

This document defines **what operators MAY change**, **what operators MUST NOT change**, and **how deviations are formally approved** within the Graduation Vault ecosystem.

Its purpose is to:
- Prevent governance drift across schools and cohorts
- Protect students, families, donors, and operators
- Preserve Graduation Vaults as institution-grade, non-custodial infrastructure

This policy applies to **all operators**, including school staff, contractors, implementation partners, and third-party service providers.

---

## Operator Definition

An **Operator** is any individual or entity responsible for configuring, deploying, or maintaining Graduation Vault infrastructure **without holding keys or governance authority**.

Operators:
- Configure SAFE + Zodiac according to approved templates
- Do **not** hold private keys
- Do **not** approve transactions
- Do **not** execute withdrawals
- Do **not** override governance rules

---

## Non-Negotiable Invariants (MUST NOT CHANGE)

The following invariants are foundational. **No deviation is permitted under any circumstance.**

### 1. Non-Custodial Architecture
- Operators must never hold private keys
- Operators must never be added as signers
- Operators must never initiate or execute transactions

### 2. Donation-Only Designation
- No yield strategies
- No investment representations
- No pooling of student funds
- No discretionary asset management

### 3. Mandatory Parent / Guardian Signer
- A Parent or Legal Guardian must always remain a mandatory signer
- This role may not be removed, bypassed, or replaced

### 4. Graduation Lock Enforcement
- Funds must remain locked until graduation eligibility
- Early withdrawals are allowed only via documented hardship policy

### 5. Governance Threshold Floors
- Graduation withdrawals: **minimum 3-of-4**
- Emergency / hardship withdrawals: **4-of-4 only**

### 6. Destination Safety
- Graduation payouts must go to a **Student + Parent joint SAFE**
- EOAs are not permitted as graduation destinations

---

## Approved Operator-Level Configurations (MAY CHANGE)

The following configurations may be adjusted **without additional approval**, provided they do not violate invariants.

### 1. Network Selection
- Operators may select supported networks with mature SAFE + Zodiac tooling

### 2. Graduation Date / Time Parameters
- Graduation unlock date may be configured per student

### 3. Signer Identity (Within Role)
- Individuals filling SCHOOL, STAFF, or TRUSTEE roles may change
- Role count and structure must remain unchanged

### 4. Presentation Layer
- Branding
- UI layout
- Read-only dashboards
- Educational content

---

## Conditional Deviations (REQUIRE FORMAL APPROVAL)

The following changes require **documented signer approval** and must be recorded.

### 1. Threshold Increases
- Increasing thresholds above baseline is allowed
- Decreasing thresholds is prohibited

### 2. Additional Guards
- Extra safety guards may be added
- Guards must not weaken existing restrictions

### 3. Extended Timelocks
- Longer lock periods are allowed
- Shorter lock periods are prohibited

### 4. Hardship Policy Customization
- Schools may define hardship criteria
- Full consensus requirement may not be reduced

---

## Prohibited Changes (MUST NEVER OCCUR)

The following actions are explicitly forbidden:

- Adding operators as signers
- Allowing EOAs as graduation payout destinations
- Enabling yield, staking, or strategy execution
- Removing Transaction Guards
- Removing Roles Modifiers
- Allowing withdrawals without Parent approval
- Circumventing LOCKED state restrictions

Any instance of these actions invalidates the Graduation Vault deployment.

---

## Deviation Approval Process

When a conditional deviation is requested:

1. Deviation request is documented
2. Rationale is clearly stated
3. Impact assessment is provided
4. **All signers approve**
5. Deviation is recorded with timestamp and Safe address

Unrecorded deviations are not permitted.

---

## Enforcement

This policy is enforced through:
- SAFE signer thresholds
- Zodiac Roles and Guards
- Institutional documentation requirements

Failure to adhere constitutes a governance breach.

---

## Status

- Version: v1.0
- Scope: Ecosystem-wide baseline
- Change Control: Signer-approved only

---

**Graduation Vaults are infrastructure, not discretion.**
