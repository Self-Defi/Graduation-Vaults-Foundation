# Change Control — GV Foundation

This document defines how changes to the GV-Foundation standards are proposed, reviewed, approved, and recorded.

GV-Foundation is treated as **governed infrastructure**, not an evolving product.

---

## Scope

This change-control policy applies to:
- Architecture definitions
- Operator Quickstart procedures
- Governance manifests (Roles & Guards)
- Signer, donor, and operator policies
- Any document that defines enforcement, authority, or invariants

---

## Change Categories

### 1. Editorial Changes (Low Risk)
Examples:
- Typographical corrections
- Clarifications that do not alter meaning
- Formatting or structure improvements

**Approval Required:**  
- Maintainer review  
- No signer approval required

---

### 2. Operational Changes (Moderate Risk)
Examples:
- Clarifying operator steps
- Adding optional safety checks
- Expanding documentation for existing rules

**Approval Required:**  
- Maintainer review  
- Documentation update recorded  
- Reference to unchanged invariants

---

### 3. Governance Changes (High Risk)
Examples:
- Signer role definitions
- Threshold rules
- Lock conditions
- Graduation or emergency logic
- Guard or Roles behavior

**Approval Required:**  
- Formal signer approval (as defined in the Operator Deviations Policy)
- Written rationale
- Impact assessment
- Effective date
- Version increment

---

## Prohibited Changes

The following changes are **not permitted** under any circumstances:
- Introducing custody by operators or advisors
- Removing mandatory Parent/Guardian signer role
- Allowing EOAs as graduation destinations
- Weakening withdrawal thresholds
- Enabling yield, staking, or investment behavior

Any attempt to introduce these changes invalidates the GV-Foundation standard.

---

## Versioning Rules

- All governance-affecting documents must include a version and status
- Major version changes indicate governance-level modifications
- Historical versions must remain accessible

---

## Recordkeeping

For governance-level changes, the following must be recorded:
- Change description
- Rationale
- Affected documents
- Approval record
- Timestamp
- Safe address(es), if applicable

The on-chain configuration remains the ultimate source of truth.

---

## Final Statement

GV-Foundation exists to **remove discretion from critical systems**.

Change is allowed — but only when it is:
- Explicit
- Approved
- Documented
- Auditable

Infrastructure does not drift.
